# This project has been semi-retired

As of August 2025, it is possible to use ``cibuildwheel`` to compile and test
iOS wheels. As a result, we are no longer actively working on this project.

We have no plans to add Python 3.14+ support for any of the recipes, to bump any
of the versions currently being packaged, or to add any new recipes.

If you want iOS support for a package, we encourage you to open a feature
request on the upstream project's repository, and work with the maintainers of
that project to add official iOS (and Android) support to those projects.

The project has not been fully archived so that we can maintain existing levels of
support for iOS on Python versions prior to 3.13 (the first Python release with
official iOS support).

# Mobile Forge

This is a forge-like environment that can be used to build wheels for mobile
platforms. It is currently only tested for iOS, but in theory, it should also be
usable for Android. Contributions to verify Android support, tvOS and watchOS
support, and to add more package recipes, are enthusiastically encouraged.

## Usage

This repo contains an activation script that will configure your environment so
it's ready to use. To set up a build environment:

1. Ensure you have `git-lfs` installed (`git lfs --version` should return a
   version number, not an error). `git-lfs` is available from
   [https://git-lfs.com](https://git-lfs.com), or by running
   `brew install git-lfs`.

2. Clone this repository:

    ```text
    git clone https://github.com/beeware/mobile-forge.git
    ```

    ```text
    cd mobile-forge
    ```

3. Run the script for the Python version you want to use, providing the support
   revision:

    ```text
    source ./setup-iOS.sh 3.11
    ```

Running this script will create a Python virtual environment, install Mobile
Forge and some other required tools, and provide some hints at forge commands
you can run.

If a virtual environment already exists, it will be activated, and the same hints
displayed.

`lru-dict` is a good first package to try compiling:

```text
  (venv3.11) $ forge iOS lru-dict
```

Or, to build a wheel for a single architecture:

```text
  (venv3.11) $ forge iphonesimulator:12.0:arm64 lru-dict
```

Once this command completes, there should be a wheel for each platform in the `dist`
folder. A log for each successful build will be in the `logs` folder; a log for each
unsuccessful build (if there are any) will be in the `errors` folder.

### Local support package builds

By default, the Mobile Forge setup script will download a support revision and
use the binaries in the downloaded package. However, you can also use a local
build of the support package.

After cloning and building
[Python-Apple-support](https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support), set the
`PYTHON_APPLE_SUPPORT` environment variable to the root of the
Python-Apple-support checkout. Then run the `setup-iOS.sh` script to configure
your environment.

### Specific support package builds

The Mobile Forge setup script will download a support package for any supported
Python version. The version that is downloaded is hard-coded in the setup
script. To use a specific revision rather than the default, add the revision
number as an additional argument to the setup script. For example, to use
revision 4 of the 3.11 support package, run:

```text
source ./setup-iOS.sh 3.11 4
```

## The special snowflakes

Mobile Forge is trying to support multiple packages, building on multiple Python
versions, for multiple architectures; and some of those Python versions were released
before the release of ARM64 macOS hardware. As a result, some versions of some packages
have some quirks that must be taken into account.

### Pandas

Pandas uses a meta-package named `oldest-supported-numpy` to ensure ABI compatibility
during compilation. However, this can install a different version of numpy, depending on
the platform. This is especially problematic for Python 3.9, because the minimum
supported version for Python 3.9 on ARM64 is different to the version that is installed
for x86_64. Mobile-forge produces a replacement `oldest-supported-numpy` package, tagged
as version 2999.1.1, which ensures that consistent versions are available for build
purposes; however, this wheel *should not* be published.

### Cryptography

Cryptography currently builds a *very* old version (3.4.8). This is the last version
that could be built without a Rust compiler.

## What now?

To include these wheels in a test project, you can add the `dist` folder as a links
source in your `requires` definition in your Briefcase `pyproject.toml`. For
example, the following will install the `lru-dict` wheels you've just compiled:

```text
requires = [
    "--find-links", "/path/to/mobile-forge/dist",
    "lru-dict",
]
```

## Adding your own packages

If there's a package that you want that doesn't have an existing recipe, you can add a
recipe for that package.

Create a directory in `recipes`. The name of the directory must be in PyPI normalized
form (PEP 503). Alternatively, you can create this directory somewhere else, and pass
its path when calling `forge`.

Inside the recipe directory, add the following files.

- A `meta.yaml` file. This supports a subset of Conda syntax, defined in `meta-schema.yaml`.
- A `test.py` file (or `test` package), to run on a target installation. This should contain a
  pytest suite which imports the package and does some basic checks.
- Optionally, one or more patch files in a folder named `patches`. These patches will be
  applied when the source code is unpacked for a given platform.
- For non-Python packages, a `build.sh` script. This is the script that will be executed
  in the build environment build the package. This script should invoke any `configure`,
  `make`, or any other compilation steps needed to build the package. This script will be
  executed in an environment that defines the following environment variables:

  - `AR` - the `AR` value used to compile the host Python, as determined from
    `sysconfig`
  - `CC` - the `CC` value used to compile the host Python, as determined from
    `sysconfig`.
  - `CFLAGS` - the `CFLAGS` value used to compile the host Python, as determined
    from `sysconfig`, augmented with the include paths for the SDK, and
    `opt/include` in the host environment's site-packages.
  - `LDFLAGS` - the `CFLAGS` value used to compile the host Python, as determined
    from `sysconfig`, augmented with the library paths for the SDK, and
    `opt/lib` in the host environment's site-packages.
  - `CPU_COUNT` - The number of CPUs that are available, as determined by
    `multiprocessing.cpu_count()`
  - `HOST_TRIPLET` - the GCC compiler triplet for the host platform (e.g.,
    `aarch64-apple-ios12.0-simulator`)
  - `BUILD_TRIPLET` - the GCC compiler triplet for the build platform (e.g.,
    `aarch64-apple-darwin`)
  - `PREFIX` - a location where the compiled package can be installed in preparation
    for packaging.

  This script should install the package into `$PREFIX`. Mobile Forge will package any
  content installed into `$PREFIX` into a "wheel" that can be installed as a host
  requirement.

### Python-based projects

All Python projects are compiled using `python -m build`, using a clean
[crossenv](https://github.com/benfogle/crossenv) virtual environment for each platform of a
package. Any PEP518 build requirements will be included in both the host and build
environments.

If you're lucky, all you'll need to do is define a `meta.yaml` that describes the
package name and version: e.g.:

```text
package:
  name: blis
  version: 0.4.1
```

If this doesn't result in a successful build, it will likely be for one of the following
reasons:

1. **The build process has a dependency on a system library**. For example, Pillow has a
   dependency on `libjpeg`. `libjpeg` isn't available on PyPI; but it *is* possible
   to build a "wheel" for `libjpeg`, so it can be specified as a requirement.

   A non-python "wheel" is constructed by compiling the package for your target platform,
   then installing it into a folder named `opt`. As a result of this "install", you'll
   usually end up with an `opt/include` and `opt/lib` folder; Mobile Forge will then
   wrap up this `opt` folder in a wheel, along with Python wheel metadata.

   When this "wheel" is specified as a host requirement, the "wheel" will be unpacked
   into the site packages folder of your cross-compilation host environment. This path
   the `include` and `lib` paths will be automatically included in the
   `CFLAGS`/`LDFLAGS` environment variables when the Python build is executed.

2. **The build process has a dependency on external tooling**. Mobile Forge will
   configure a C and C++ compiler using the same configuration that was used to compile
   the support libraries; however a package may require addition build tooling (e.g., a
   Fortran compiler) to complete the build. If this is the case, you'll need to find a
   version of the tool that can target mobile platforms, and work out how to modify the
   build process to apply any necessary compiler flags.

3. **The build script has platform-specific logic**. For example,
   if the `setup.py` file contain an `if sys.platform == ...` clauses, it is unlikely
   that a mobile platform will trigger the right logic.

If you need to make any alterations to a project's source code for a build to succeed,
you can provide those patches by putting them in one or more files in a folder named
`patches` in the recipe folder. These patches will be applied once the source code
has been unpacked.

### Configure-based projects

If the project includes a `configure` script, you will likely need to provide a patch
for `config.sub`. `config.sub` is the tools used by `configure` to identify the
architecture and machine type; however, it doesn't currently recognize the host triples
used by Apple. If you get the error:

```text
checking host system type... Invalid configuration `arm64-apple-ios': machine `arm64-apple' not recognized
configure: error: /bin/sh config/config.sub arm64-apple-ios failed
```

you will need to patch `config.sub`. There are several examples of patched `config.sub`
scripts in the packages contained in this repository, and in the Python-Apple-support
project; it is quite possible one of those patches can be used for the library you are
trying to compile. The `config.sub` script has a datestamp at the top of the file; that
can be used to identify which patch you will need.
